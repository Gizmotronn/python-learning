# Basic Data types in Python

One of the great things about Python is that there are few keywords built into Python, making it easier to learn than many other languages. 

An example of a "keyword"  is the "print" function, which prints an output to the Python console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The print function can also print an output, or calculation:

```python
print(5*5)
# prints 25 to the console
```

## Integers

* There is no limit to how long an integer is in Python 3

Printing an integer: 

```python
print(123123123)
>>> #prints 123123123
```

If there is no prefix before the sequence of numbers, Python interprets this as a decimal-type integer.
