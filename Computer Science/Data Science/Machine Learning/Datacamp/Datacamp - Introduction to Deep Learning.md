# Datacamp - Introduction to Deep Learning

[Course Link - `Datacamp`](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python/basics-of-deep-learning-and-neural-networks?ex=1)

## Notes

* We work for a bank
* We need to predict how many transactions a/each customer will make each/next year

This will depend on a number of variables:

1. Age
2. Bank Balance
3. Retirement Status
4. ...



**Linear Regression Model** for this

* Assumes that the *number of transactions* is a sum of individual parts
* It identifies the relationships & interactions between these parts/variables



## Interactions

* Deep learning uses powerful *neural networks*
  * Text
  * Images
  * Audio
  * Videos
  * Source files/code



## Interactions in a neural network

* Input layer
  * Age
  * Income
  * (#) of accounts
* Output layer
  * Number of transactions
* Anything else - hidden layer
