# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## AWS DeepRacer Preview

* Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning
* An *agent* explores an *environment* to **learn** how to **perform desired tasks** by taking *actions* with good outcomes and avoiding actions with bad outcomes
* A reinforcement learning model will *learn from its experiences* and will learn to *identify* which actions lead to the *best rewards*

Other types of machine learning include:

* Supervised: Example-driven training
  * Labeled data [sets] of known outputs for given inputs, a model is trained to predict output for new inputs
* Unsupervised learning: Interference-based training
  * With unlabeled data [sets] without known outputs, a model is trained to identify related structures or similar patterns within the input data.

**Reward?**

* In reinforcement learning, an *agent* interacts with an *environment* with an objective to maximize its total *reward*
* The agent takes an *action* based on the environment *state*, which then returns the reward and the next state.
* Using trial and error, the agent learns from this and after initially taking random actions, it starts identifying the actions that lead to long-term rewards



*Agent*

* The agent simulates the AWS DeepRacer vehicle in the simulation for training
* It embodies the neural network that controls the vehicle, taking inputs and deciding actions
