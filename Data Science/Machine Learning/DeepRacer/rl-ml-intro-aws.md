# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## AWS DeepRacer Preview

* Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning
* An *agent* explores an *environment* to **learn** how to **perform desired tasks** by taking *actions* with good outcomes and avoiding actions with bad outcomes
* A reinforcement learning model will *learn from its experiences* and will learn to *identify* which actions lead to the *best rewards*

Other types of machine learning include:

* Supervised: Example-driven training
  * Labeled data [sets] of known outputs for given inputs, a model is trained to predict output for new inputs
* Unsupervised learning: Interference-based training
  * With unlabeled data [sets] without known outputs, a model is trained to identify related structures or similar patterns within the input data.
