# Interacting with Python

My first code with Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## REPL

The python interpreter

* __R__eads the command you enter
* __E__valuates and executes the command
* __P__rints the output (if any) to the console
* __L__oops back and repeats the process

REPL is the most straightforward way to start talking to Python.

## Hello World

This is what hello, world looks like with Python:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```
