# Interacting with Python

My first code with Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## REPL

The python interpreter

* __R__eads the command you enter
* __E__valuates and executes the command
* __P__rints the output (if any) to the console
* __L__oops back and repeats the process

REPL is the most straightforward way to start talking to Python.

## Hello World

This is what hello, world looks like with Python:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

## Python Editor

To exit from the editor:

```python
exit()
```

## Python scripts

When I create long chains of Python code, I should save them as a script, or a code file. It is a reusable file. Once the file is saved, I can open the Python window and paste in the directory to that file, for example

```
C:\Users\arbuc\documents\github\learning-python\helloworld.py
```

Python will then run the code.



An easier way to run a script is to use a text/code editor, also known as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

* Pycharm (jetbrains, freemium) (made for Python)
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* IDLE (made for Python)
