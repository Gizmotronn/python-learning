# Step 2 - Modules & Libraries

* NumPy - NumPy allows easy and efficient numeric computation, and many other data science libraries are built on top of it.
* Pandas - Pandas is high-performance library for data structures and exploratory analysis. It's built on top of NumPy.
* Scikit-learn - Scikit-Learn is the premier general-purpose machine learning library in Python. It has many popular algorithms and modules for pre-processing, cross-validation, and much more.
* Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a flexible plotting and visualization library. It's powerful but somewhat cumbersome. You have the option of skipping Matplotlib for now and using Seaborn to get started (see our Seaborn recommendation below).
* Seaborn: Seaborn makes it much easier to plot common data visualizations. It's built on top of Matplotlib and offers a more pleasant high-level wrapper.
