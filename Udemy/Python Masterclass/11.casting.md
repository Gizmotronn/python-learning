# Casting (Changing the data type)

## Strings & Integer Variables

```python
number1 = "5" # string variable 
number2 = 10 # integer variable
```

Right now, we've got two (2) variables set:

* Number1 (String) | Value = "5"

* Number2 (Integer) | Value = 10

### Error 1

If I just added these 2 variables together:

```py
number3 = number1 + number2 # results in a syntax error
```

#### Fixing error 1

```python
number3 = int(number1) + number2
```

By adding "int(" to the variable, we change the data type of variable "number1" from a **string** into an **integer.**

```python
print(number3) # prints "15"
```

### Adding 2 strings together

```python
number3 = number1 + str(number2) # prints "510" as 10 is added to the right of the 5, like how you would add two characters/letters together, as both variables are now strings
```

### Error 2

```python
number1 = "ggg"
number2 = 5
number3 = number2 + number1
```

Even if I was to convert "number1" into a string, there would still be an error:

```python
number3 = int(number1) + number2
```

And this is because "ggg" is not a number, so it is an invalid value for any integer or float variable.

However, we can add these two variables together:

##### Fixing Error 2

```python
number3 = number1 + str(number2) # and this gives us "ggg5" // See "adding two strings together"
```

### Floats

```python
number1 = 11.55
number2 = 3 # could be represented as a float or an integer, but to make sure it's an integer:

number2 = int(number2)

number3 = number1 + number2
```

```python
number3 = float(number2) + number1
```

The same rules regarding converting strings/integers also apply to floats

#### Types of errors

* Syntax

* Type

### Other stuff

* Changing a variable's data type to the current data type does not result in an error and the program continues to run

## Full code

```py
number1 = "5"  # string variable 
number2 = 10 # integer variable

# number3 = number1 + number2 // Error 1

number3 = int(number1) + number2 # Fixing Error 1
print(number3)


number1 = "ggg"
number2 = 5

#number3 = number1 + number2


number3 = number1 + str(number2)
print(number3)


number1 = 11.55
number2 = 3 # could be represented as a float or an integer, but to make sure it's an integer:

number2 = int(number2)

number3 = number1 + number2
```
