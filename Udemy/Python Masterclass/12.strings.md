# Strings

These are both strings:

```python
"string"
'string'
```



```python
stringVar = "Hello" # string variable aka
```

## Printing parts of a string

```python
print(stringVar) # prints whole string
print(stringVar[0]) # index value - starting from 0 // Prints "H"
print(stringVar[1]) ## prints "e" 
```

* Indexing is how we can print parts of a string (as well as doing other things)

* Index values start from 0 - the first value of a variable is the "0th" or where the index value is 0



An error:

```python
print(stringVar[5]) # index error
```

* While there are 5 characters in the string "stringVar", if the index value is 5, then it is referring to the **6th** character, which doesn't exist, thus resulting in an index error:

* ```
  string index out of range
  ```
