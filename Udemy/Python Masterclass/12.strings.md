# Strings

These are both strings:

```python
"string"
'string'
```

```python
stringVar = "Hello" # string variable aka
```

## Printing parts of a string

```python
print(stringVar) # prints whole string
print(stringVar[0]) # index value - starting from 0 // Prints "H"
print(stringVar[1]) ## prints "e" 
```

* Indexing is how we can print parts of a string (as well as doing other things)

* Index values start from 0 - the first value of a variable is the "0th" or where the index value is 0

An error:

```python
print(stringVar[5]) # index error
```

* While there are 5 characters in the string "stringVar", if the index value is 5, then it is referring to the **6th** character, which doesn't exist, thus resulting in an index error:

* ```
  string index out of range
  ```

* We can also select (specific) multiple characters from a string:

```python
print(stringVar[1:4]) # index values - prints the second-fourth characters // "ell" // The "4", or 4th index (fifth character) is not included
```

We can also use index values in variables:

```python
stringVar2 = stringVar[1:4]
```

We can start at different positions:

```python
stringVar2 = stringVar[2:4]
```

## Determining Lengths of string:

```python
print(len(stringVar)) # len for length // "5" for 5 characters (five)
```

As with everything else in Python, this can also be done in the form of a variable (being created to store the length).

This is useful for determining indexing & the number of the last character that can be indexed.

(Do index values work with other data types in python)?

## Removing whitespaces

At the beginning or end of a string:

```python
stringWithWhitespace = " s 64ghs " 
print(stringWithWhitespace.strip()) # like with python modules - .
```

* Does not remove spaces inside the content (the output of the above command was "s 64ghs" with no whitespace before or after, but a space still remaining in the middle

## String Capitalization/Decapitalization

```python
stringVar3 = "hello"
print(stringVar3.capitalize()) # outputs "Hello" - first character capitalized // index
```

* Caps locks:

```python
print(stringVar3.upper())
```

* Turning it into a lowercase: (also decapitalize for individual characters - find that out

```python
stringVar4 = "hELLo" 
print(stringVar4.lower())
```

## Changing characters in strings

```python
stringVar5 = "shshshshs" 
print(stringVar5.replace('h', 'a')) # replaces all 'h' with 'a'
print(stringVar5.replace) # choose the count or index values
```

## Splitting strings

```python
stringVar6 = "hello hello hello" 
print(stringVar.split(' ')) # splits whenever there is a space in the string
```

* This creates an array: 

* ```python
  ['hello', 'hello', 'hello']
  ```
