# Getting the input

## Step 1 - Defining a message variable

```python
msg = "Your Name: "
print(msg)
userName = input() # asks the user for input, and sets this input as the value for this variable
print("Hello, " + userName)
```

* What I would usually do here is something more like this:

```python
userName = input("Your name: ") # the space is there so that in the console you have the necessary white space
print("Hello, " + userName)
```

* This removes the need to create two variables and shortens it down to two lines, while performing the same function:

* I sent a comment through to Luke (lecturer for this course) regarding this

## Determining the variable type of the input

There may be times when we want to determine the variable of an input (or other variables in general, not just inputs). We can find this by doing the following:

```python
.... #previous code
variableType = type(userName)
print(variableType) # outputs "<class 'str'>"
```

* Even when the user input in this case is "2", it is classed as a string

* Therefore, this can be important for changing the data type of a variable
