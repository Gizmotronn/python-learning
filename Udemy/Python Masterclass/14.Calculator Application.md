# Calculator Application

Will ask users for input and perform mathematical operations on the input(s)

## Getting the two inputs

```python
print("Enter first number: ")
firstNumber = input()
print("Enter second number: ")
secondNumber = input() 
```

* As seen in [`13.getting-the-input.md`](https://github.com/IrisDroidology/python-learning/commit/91ccf79dc943fa8fe333b0db4bd2439ee30a2ca6), the way that the instructor (Luke) gets the input and the way I get the input differ, so I'll create the program twice using both ways 

My way:

```python
firstNumber = input("Enter first number: ")
secondNumber = input("Enter second number: ")
```

## Mathematical Operations

Now that we have the first two inputs from the user, we can perform some (simple) mathematical operations:

```python
.... # previous code
print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
```

* This doesn't work, as input variables are set to the `string` data type

* We then need to convert the data type to be able to perform mathematical operations, from a string to an integer (or even to a float)

* BTW, from now on (unless mentioned otherwise) assume that `.... # previous code` is inserted

```python
firstNumber = int(firstNumber) # converts the string to an integet variable
secondNumber = int(secondNumber)
```

Luke did it a bit differently, where he converted the data type right from when the input was first gathered:

```python
firstNumber = int(input("Enter first number: ")
... # this snippet refers to the first set of code snippets, it should not be inserted at this point in the program
```

Now we're able to perform those mathematical operations:

### Addition

```python
numberTotal = firstNumber + secondNumber
print(firstNumber + " added to " + secondNumber + " is equal to: " + numberTotal)
```

### Multiplication

```python
numberProduct = firstNumber * secondNumber
print(str(firstNumber) + " multiplied by " + str(secondNumber) + " is equal to: " + str(numberProduct))
```

...

We can do the same with the 3 other main mathematical operators in python:

* Subtraction (-)

* Division (/)

* Modulus (%) - calculate the remainder of a division operation

We can also put `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` into strings for the output, as in saying "firstNumber multiplied by secondNumber is equal to: numberProduct" for example

We could also do this: 

```python
numberProduct = firstNumber * secondNumber
print(str(firstNumber) + " x " + str(secondNumber) + " = " + str(numberProduct))
```

Replacing it with the specific mathematical operator in use.
