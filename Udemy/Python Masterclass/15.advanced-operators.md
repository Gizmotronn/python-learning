# Advanced Operators

### Exponentials

```python
number = 10
number2 = 10 ** 2 # 10 to the power of 2 // Exponential
print(number2) # prints (outputs) 100 to the console
```

## Main types of operators in Python

[Python Operators: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical and more.](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators)

| Operator | Meaning                                                          | Example |
|:--------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition - Add 1 number to another                               | 10 + 10 |
| -        | Subtraction - Take 1 number from another                         | 10 - 10 |
| *        | Multiplication - Multiply 1 number by another                    | 10 * 10 |
| /        | Division - Divide 1 number by another                            | 10 / 10 |
| //       | Floor division - Rounds the result to a whole number             | 10 //10 |
| %        | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | 10 % 4  |
| **       | Exponential -Â left operand raised to the power of right          | 10 ** 2 |

## Floor division

```python
number1 = 10
number2 = 4
print(number1 // number2) # Results in 2 - result rounded to nearest whole number
print(number1 / number2) # Results in 2.5 - total 
print(number1 % number2) # Results in 2 - remainder
```

This code can also be viewed in `15.advanced-operators.py` in this folder on the repo.

## Operators on already establish variable values

```python
....
number2 += 1 # adds 1 to the value of number2, so it becomes 5
```

A slower way of typing this is:

```python
....
number2 = number2 + 1
```

You need to make sure that the data types are correct though!
