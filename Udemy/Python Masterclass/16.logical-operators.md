# Logical Operators

* if we want to determine if two variables are equal, we use two equals signs:

```python
number1 = 10
number2 = 20
result = number1 == number2
print(result) # False
```

* If we want to determine if two variables are different, we do this:

```python
....
result = number1 != number2 # != ==> not equal
print(result) # prints true
```

* Numbers that are smaller or bigger (variables):

```python
result = number1 <= number2 # less than or equal to
print(result) # True

result = number2 >= number1 # greater than or equal to
print(result) # True
```

* We can also just use >, or <, rather than >=, <=

Conditional statement: `number1 <= number2`

* You can combine conditional statements:

```python
....
result = (number2 >= number1) and (number1 <= number2)
print(result) # True
```

* If at least 1 statement is `false`, the entire thing is `false`

* The terminal only shows `true` if all the statements are `true` 

```python
.....
result = not number2 >= number1
print(result) # False
```
