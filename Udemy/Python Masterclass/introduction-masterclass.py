# Hi  there!Â My name is Liam Arbuckle, I'm from Australia, and I'm enrolled in this course to learn more about Python. I have a little bit of experience in Python - including lists, tuples, and a little bit of pygame, however I don't have much experience in putting those tools to real world use. This course looks like a way to fix that!
