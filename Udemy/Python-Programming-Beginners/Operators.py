# Operators - What are Operators & Different types of Operators

# What are Operators?
# An Operator performs a function between 2 operants, for example:

additionOperator = 5 + 6 # sets the value of the INTEGER VARIABLE "additionOperator" to 11, or 5+6

# Types of Operators
    # Assignment Operator
    # Arithmetic Operator
    # Relational Operator
    # Logical Operator


        # Assignment Operators  
        # Assigning a value to a variable, for example
assignmentOperator = "string" # the assignment operator in this case is the equals sign, on column 20


        # Arithmetic Operators
        # Addition (+), Multiplication (*), Subtraction (-), Division (/), Modulus (%)
myModulus = 5 % 2 # sets the value of the variable "myModulus" to the remainder of 5 divided by 2

        # Relational Operators
        # To compare values (of variables...)


        # Logical Operators
        # Combination of relational operators
        # "And" operation, + "or" operation
