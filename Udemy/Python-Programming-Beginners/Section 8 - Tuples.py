# Tuple - a collection of immutable objects (can't be changed - e.g. d.o.b). 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
tupleName = (object1, object2) # sets the values of the objects in the tuple "tupleName" to "object1"  & "object2"
tupleName # prints the values of the tuple "tupleName" to the console

# Accessing values in a tuple
tupleName[0] # returns "object1"

# Deleting tuples
del(tupleName) # Deletes the tuple
tupleName = (object1, object2) # Creates tupleName again!
