# String Operations

# string.upper()
string = "this is a string" # sets the value of the variable "string", which is a string variable, to "this is a string"
string.upper() # prints the value of the variable "string", however all in uppercase. E.g. 'THIS IS A STRING'

# string.lower
string.lower() # converts the value of a string to all lower case values

# Replacement Operation
string.replace("string", "string variable") # replaces the "string" in "this is a string" (the variable named string, which is a string variable) with "string variable"

# Slice Operation
string[0:4] # Uses index values to "slice" the value, which means that instead of printing "this is a string" when the "string" variable is called upon, it displays the first 5 (4) characters - "this "

# Length Operation
len(string) # prints how many index numbers/characters are in the string (13 letters + 3 spaces = 16 characters)
