* Just as with other programming languages, basic operators (+, -, /, *) can be used in Python

An example of using operators in integer variables;

```python
number = 1 + 2 # sets the value of the int variable "number" to 3
print(number) # prints the value of the variable "number", in this case 3

# note: all the code on these documentation files are also put into Python files in the same folder
```

* There are many different operators:

## Types of Operators

* +. Addition
* -. Subtraction
* *. Multiplication
* /. Division
* %. Modulus - returns the remainder of a division

Modulus example:

```python
remainder = 11 % 3 # sets the value of the variable "remainder" to the remainder of 11 divided by 3
print(remainder)
```

2 multiplication symbols put together create a power relationship:

```python
squared = 7 ** 2 # sets the value of "squared" (an integer variable) to the value of 7^2 - 49
cubed = 7 ** 3 # sets the value of "cubed" (an integer/float variable) to the value of 7^3 = 343
print(cubed + squared) # prints the value of cubed added to the value of squared
```
