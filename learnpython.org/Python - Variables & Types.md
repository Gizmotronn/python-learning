# Variables & Types

*From LearnPython.org*

https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types

* Python is **object oriented**
  * It is not **statically typed**
  * This means you do not need to declare variables before using them
  * You also do not need to declare their type

## Types of Variables - Numbers

* Integer - whole number

An example of setting up an integer and printing it:

```python
myint = 7 # this sets the value of "myint" to 7
print(myint) # this prints the value of "myint", in this case 
```
