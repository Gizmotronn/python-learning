# Variables & Types

*From LearnPython.org*

https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types

* Python is **object oriented**
  * It is not **statically typed**
  * This means you do not need to declare variables before using them
  * You also do not need to declare their type

## Types of Variables - Numbers

### Integer 

* Integer - whole number

An example of setting up an integer and printing it:

```python
myint = 7 # this sets the value of "myint" to 7
print(myint) # this prints the value of "myint", in this case 7
```

### Floating point number

* Floating point number - number with decimal point

**Can be a whole number!**

```python
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)
```
