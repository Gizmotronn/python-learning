# Integers
myint = 7 # this sets the value of "myint" to 7
print(myint) # this prints the value of "myint", in this case 7

# Floating point numbers
myfloat = 7.0 # this sets the value of "myfloat" to 7.0
print(myfloat) # this prints the value of "myfloat"
myfloat = float(7) # this sets the calue of "myfloat" to the float of "7", making it 7.0
print(myfloat) # this prints the value of "myfloat" - like with line 7

# Strings
# Example of String variable in Python
mystring = "This is a string"
print(mystring) # prints the variable of "mystring"

# Operators
string1 = "This is a string"
string2 = "that is half-complete"
print(string1 + string2) #prints the value of "string1" & "string2", in this case "This is a string""that is half-complete". Note that there is no space between string1 and string2

# in terms of line 8, you can either do line 8 or line 6 to declare a floating point variable
